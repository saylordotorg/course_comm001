**Unit 2: Interpersonal Communication** <span id="2"></span> 
*You engage in interpersonal communication every day, for example with
strangers at the grocery store, with friends and family at home, or with
peers at work.  This second unit will define interpersonal communication
and will provide an application of the basic elements addressed in Unit
1.  You will investigate interpersonal communication in its formal and
informal settings. * *This unit will also include a discussion of
conflict management.  Conflicts arise in all relationships – with family
and friends as well as with colleagues in the work or service
environment.  Understanding and applying human communication principles
to these situations can often help to diffuse conflicts and even prevent
conflict. * *In the units to follow, you will explore additional
applications of interpersonal communication.*

**Unit 2 Time Advisory**  
This unit will take you 28.5 hours to complete.
