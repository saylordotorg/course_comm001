Course Syllabus for "COMM001: Principles Of Human Communication"
----------------------------------------------------------------

In the 1960’s, H. Marshall McLuhan, media theorist, critic, and
visionary, asserted that societies are changed by the advances of
technology, especially communication technologies.  He is well known for
his prophecy that communication technology would one day make us one
great “global village.”  In the end, the processes and theories
regarding communication in our daily lives to exchange information,
create meaning, and share understanding remain a critical component of
human relationships.  Whether we are chatting with a stranger while
waiting for a bus, solving a problem with a group of coworkers, or
sharing our dreams and goals with our best friend, principles and
practices of human communication are at the foundation of each of these
human transactions. This course provides an introduction to the human
communication concentration in the communications major.  This course
will introduce you to communication principles, common communication
practices, and a selection of theories to better understand the
communication transactions that you experience in your daily life.  The
principles and practices that you study in this course will provide the
foundation for further advanced studies and skills required in the
communications major. Your studies in this course will begin with an
overview of communication as a process along with basic principles and
theories.  Subsequent units in the course examine specific applications
of human communication in your personal and professional life.  These
include interpersonal communication, small group communication and
decision making, and organizational communication or human communication
in the workplace. By the end of this course, you will be able to
identify the process of human communication in a number of settings that
affect your daily activities.  Additionally, you will be able to use the
principles and theories to improve communication transactions in your
life and understand how communication adds to the success of
professional and personal relationships.

### Course Information

Welcome to COMM001: Principles of Human Communication.  Below, please
find some general information on the course and its requirements.  
    
 **Primary Resources:** This course is composed of a range of different
free, online materials.  However, the course makes primary use of the
following materials:  

-   Wikibooks: Laura K. Hahn, Lance Lippert, and Scott T. Paynton’s
    *[Survey of Communication
    Study](http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Survey_of_Communication_Study)*
-   University of Houston: Professor Martha Haun’s [Introduction to
    Communication Theory Lecture
    Series](http://freevideolectures.com/Course/2590/Introduction-to-Communication-Theory/1)
-   [*Stand Up, Speak
    Out*](http://www.saylor.org/site/textbooks/Stand%20Up,%20Speak%20Out%20-%20The%20Practice%20and%20Ethics%20of%20Public%20Speaking.pdf)
-   Connexions: Dennis River’s *[Communication Skills for Personal and
    Professional Development: The Seven Challenges
    Approach](http://cnx.org/content/m14482/latest/?collection=col10415/latest)*

**Requirements for Completion:** In order to complete this course, you
will need to work through each unit and all of its assigned materials. 
Pay special attention to Unit 1 as this will lay the groundwork for
understanding the more advanced, exploratory material presented in
latter units.  You will also need to complete:  

-   Units 1-5 Discussion Questions, Term Definitions, and Chapter
    Exercises
-   Units 1-5 Note-taking activities for all video lectures and readings
-   The Final Exam

Note that you will only receive an official grade on your Final Exam. 
However, in order to adequately prepare for this exam, you will need to
work through all course resources, the assignment on discussion
questions and defining terms, and note-taking activities listed above.  
    
 In order to “pass” this course, you will need to earn a 70% or higher
on the Final Exam.  Your score on the exam will be tabulated as soon as
you complete it.  If you do not pass the exam, you may take it again.  
    
 **Time Commitment:** This course should take you a total of
approximately **135 hours** to complete.  Each unit includes a “time
advisory” that lists the amount of time you are expected to spend on
each subunit.  These should help you plan your time accordingly.  It may
be useful to take a look at these time advisories and to determine how
much time you have over the next few weeks to complete each unit, and
then to set goals for yourself.  For example, Unit 1 should take you
approximately 52.5 hours to complete.  Perhaps you can sit down with
your calendar and decide to complete the readings for subunit 1.1 (a
total of 3.5 hours) on Monday night; the web media for subunit 1.1 (a
total of 3 hours) on Tuesday night; the readings for subunit 1.2 (a
total of 3 hours) on Wednesday night; half of the web media for subunit
1.2 (a total of 4.5 hours) on Thursday night; etc.  
    
 **Tips/Suggestions:** Make sure to organize your responses to the
Wikibooks discussion questions and definition of terms.  Also, take
comprehensive notes on each resource.  These notes, your responses to
discussion questions, and your definition of terms will help serve as a
useful review as you study for the Final Exam.
